1
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:06,400
Morty, you got to... come on.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,600
- You got to come with me.
- Rick, what's going on?

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,845
I got a surprise for you, Morty.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,200
It's the middle of the night.
What are you talking about?

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,500
I got a surprise for you.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,745
Ow!
Ow! You're tugging me too hard.

7
00:00:14,775 --> 00:00:16,745
I got a surprise for you, Morty.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,475
What do you think
of this flying vehicle, Morty?

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,450
I built it out of stuff I found
in the garage.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,175
Yeah, Rick, it's great.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,875
- Is this the surprise?
- Morty, I had to...

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,345
I had to... I had to...
I had to make a bomb, Morty.

13
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,175
- I had to create a bomb.
- What?! A bomb?!

14
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,745
We're gonna drop it down there just
get a whole fresh start, Morty.

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,230
- Create a whole fresh start.
- T-t-that's absolutely crazy!

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,745
Come on, Morty.
Just take it easy, Morty.

17
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,715
It's gonna be good.

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,115
Right now, we're gonna go pick
up your little friend Jessica.

19
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,915
Jessica?
From my math class?

20
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,345
When I drop the bomb...

21
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,115
you know, I want you to

22
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,440
have somebody, you know I
want you to have the thing

23
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,181
I'm gonna make it like a new Adam
and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam.

24
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,715
And Jessica's gonna be Eve,
and so that's the surprise, Morty.

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,815
No, you can't!

26
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,375
Jessica doesn't
even know I exist.

27
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,653
But but forget about that,

28
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:03,250
because you can't
blow up humanity.

29
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:04,880
I-I get what you're
trying to say, Morty.

30
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,727
Listen, I'm not you
don't you don't got to worry about me...

31
00:01:06,753 --> 00:01:10,500
trying to fool around with with Jessica
or mess around with Jessica or anything.

32
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:11,939
I'm I'm not that
kind of guy, Morty.

33
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,575
What are you talking
about, Rick?

34
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,715
You you don't have to worry about
me getting with Jessica or anything.

35
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,615
She she she she...
she's all for you, Morty.

36
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,250
I don't care about Jessica!

37
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,250
You know what, Morty?

38
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:22,850
You're right.

39
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,600
Let's forget the girl all
together.

40
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,085
She she's probably nothing
but trouble, anyways.

41
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,645
<i>Arming neutrino bomb.</i>

42
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,075
That's it that's it, Rick.

43
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,815
I'm taking the wheel.

44
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:29,815
Get off of me, Morty!

45
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,744
I'm taking charge of
this situation, buddy.

46
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:32,790
What's gotten into you?

47
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:36,215
I'm I'm I'm I'm not gonna stand
around like some sort of dumb...

48
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,274
What are you, crazy?

49
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:39,645
...person and just
let you blow up the whole world.

50
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,615
All right, all right.

51
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,515
I'll I'll land.

52
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,480
I'll land. I'll land.

53
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,601
I'll land the thing.

54
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,175
Big tough guy all of a sudden.

55
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,345
We'll park it right here, Morty.

56
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,145
Right here on the side
of the road here.

57
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,175
Oh, thank God.

58
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,244
You know what?

59
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:56,315
That was all a test, Morty.

60
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,015
Just an elaborate test to make
you more assertive.

61
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,645
It was?

62
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,545
Sure. Why not?
I don't know.

63
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,550
You you know what, mo-

64
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,015
<i>Neutrino bomb armed.</i>

65
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,575
Um...

67
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:45,600
I see there's a new episode of
that singing show tonight.

68
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,250
Who do you guys think is gonna
be the best singer?

69
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,950
Oh, my God. His head is in his food.
I'm going to puke.

70
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,314
Morty, are you getting sick?

71
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,420
I told you not to practice-kiss
the living-room pillow.

72
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,344
The dog sleeps on it.

73
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:57,415
I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom.

74
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,314
I just I didn't get a lot of
sleep last night.

75
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,960
Maybe my dreams were just too
loud or something.

76
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,550
Or maybe you were out all night
again with grandpa Rick.

77
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,600
- What?!
- Dad?

78
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,314
What, so everyone's supposed to
sleep every single night now?

79
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,800
You realize that night time makes
up half of all time?

80
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,400
Damn it!

81
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,075
- Jerry!
- Beth!

82
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,015
Oh, my God.

83
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,475
My parents are so loud.
I want to die.

84
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,339
Mm, there is no God, summer. You
got to rip that band-aid off now.

85
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,319
You'll thank me later.

86
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:20,725
Okay, with all due respect, Rick...
What am I talking about?

87
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,274
What respect is due?

88
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:25,645
How is my son supposed to pass
his classes if you keep dragging him off

89
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,744
for high-concept
Sci-Fi rigamarole?

90
00:03:27,869 --> 00:03:30,314
Listen, Jerry, I don't want to
overstep my bounds or anything.

91
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,810
It's your house.
It's your world.

92
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:33,274
You're a real Julius Caesar.

93
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:36,274
But I'll tell you some tell you how
how I feel about school, Jerry.

94
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:39,520
It's a waste of time a bunch of people
running around, bumping into each other.

95
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,214
G-guy up front says,
"two plus two."

96
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:42,850
The people in the
back say, "four."

97
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,340
Then the bell rings, and they
give you a carton of milk

98
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,175
and a piece of paper that says you
can go take a dump or something.

99
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,814
I mean, it's it's not a place
for smart people, Jerry.

100
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,338
And I know that's not
a popular opinion,

101
00:03:53,364 --> 00:03:55,470
but it's my two
cents on the issue.

102
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,915
This was a good breakfast, Beth.

103
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,314
You really made the
crap out of those eggs.

104
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,274
I wish your mother was
here to eat them.

105
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:02,374
Oh, dad.

106
00:04:02,499 --> 00:04:05,344
What? For real?

107
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,645
All right, now,
everybody get settled.

108
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,314
Get away from the windows!

109
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,295
Now, look, we're gonna be dealing
with some real serious stuff today.

110
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,744
You might have heard of it.
It's called math.

111
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:18,349
And without it, none of us would
even exist, so let's jump right in.

112
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,750
- Two plus two.
- Jessica.

113
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,074
Five plus five.

114
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:21,944
Tenssica.

115
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:24,750
Okay, good.
It's time for the quiz.

116
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:26,915
Yeah, you know what?!
Aw, too bad!

117
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,074
Tough!

118
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,615
First row, take one.
Pass it back for me.

119
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,314
<i>The stakes are
high in this room.</i>

120
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,615
<i>There's crucial things happening
here every day.</i>

121
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,275
<i>People getting smarter.
Some of y'all getting dumber.</i>

122
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,800
<i>Some of y'all ain't
gonna see 3:00.</i>

123
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,244
<i>Hi, Morty.</i>

124
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,800
Whoa!
Hi, Jessica.

125
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,200
Can I show these to you?

126
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:47,760
Wow.

127
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,250
Th-they're both great.
Thank you.

128
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,650
You know what I named these?
My little morties.

129
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,800
Uh, that's
flattering... and a little weird.

130
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,850
Do you know what I want you
to do with them?

131
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,900
Rename them?

132
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,975
Squeeze them.

133
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,244
Manhandle them.
Give them the business.

134
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,900
See if you can shuffle them.

135
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,120
I mean, really get in there and
knock them around.

136
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,615
No wrong answers.

137
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,300
Wow. Well, okay, Jessica.
L-let's give this a shot.

138
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:11,995
Mm.

139
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,514
Oh, Morty.

140
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,314
What are you doing to me?

141
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Uh, I-I'm just doing my best.

142
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,000
Morty!
What are you doing to me?!

143
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,540
Jessica.

144
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,244
Morty!

145
00:05:21,369 --> 00:05:23,145
Jessica.

146
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,675
Five more minutes of this,
and I'm gonna get mad.

147
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,175
Je-Jessica.

148
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,215
Jessica.

149
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,250
Not my fault this is happening.

150
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,200
Well, well, well.

151
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,750
- Uh, morning, Frank.
- "Morning"?

152
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,500
What was what is that
supposed to mean?

153
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,110
You making fun of me?

154
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,575
Are you trying to say my
family's poor?

155
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,415
Oh, geez, Frank.

156
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,175
I don't know if a knife is
necessary.

157
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,145
I mean, you know, y-you kind of
had things handled without it.

158
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,814
You telling me how to bully now?
Big mistake, Morty.

159
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:52,600
And now I'm gonna cut you,
'cause my family's rich.

160
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,574
There you are, Morty.
Listen to me.

161
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:58,880
I got an errand to run in a
whole different dimension.

162
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:00,244
I need an extra pair of hands.

163
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:02,499
Oh, geez, Rick.
What'd you do to Frank?

164
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,645
It's pretty obvious, Morty.
I froze him.

165
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,275
Now listen I need
your help, Morty.

166
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,095
I mean, we got we got to get get the hell
out of here and go take care of business.

167
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:13,475
- It's important. Come on, Morty.
- I don't know, Rick.

168
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,681
I can't leave school again.

169
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:17,659
Do you have any concept of how much
higher the stakes get out there, Morty?

170
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,244
What do you think I can just
do it all by myself?

171
00:06:19,369 --> 00:06:20,215
Come on!

172
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,074
Aw, geez. Okay.
I guess I can skip history.

173
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,145
What about Frank?

174
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,631
I mean, shouldn't
you unfreeze him?

175
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:27,775
I'll do it later, Morty.
He'll be fine.

176
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,200
Let's go.

177
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,250
<i>Oh, my God. I'm about to
walk past Frank Palicky.</i>

178
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:38,275
<i>This is the story we'll be
telling our children.</i>

179
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,944
Hi, Frank.

180
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,700
Aah!

181
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,045
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

182
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:49,915
Knock, knock.

183
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,845
Jerry?

184
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,699
My manager gave me an
hour for lunch, and I thought,

185
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,150
"hey, why not swing by where
your wife works?"

186
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,639
We're losing him.
Okay, he's back.

187
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,340
Jerry, please tell me you're here
for an incredibly urgent reason.

188
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:02,675
Well, it's lunch.

189
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,320
I mean, it's one of three meals
that have existed for millennia.

190
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,261
Losing him.

191
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:07,675
Stabilized.

192
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,258
Okay, I only ask, Jerry,
because, as you know,

193
00:07:10,284 --> 00:07:12,479
my job involves
performing heart surgery.

194
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:14,915
- Well, yeah, on horses.
- Excuse me?

195
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,715
Okay.
Let's not rehash that fight.

196
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,180
I sense that you're busy and
will now be on my way.

197
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,074
Whoa!

198
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,775
What is this on the floor?

199
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,365
Some kind of literature for a
really nice-looking nursing home.

200
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,095
Hey, honey, crazy idea bad pitch
let's put your dad here.

201
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,500
Let's put your dad
in a nursing home.

202
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,201
We're losing him.

203
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,074
Hey, Tom.
We know when we're losing him.

204
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,514
We can hear the beeps!

205
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:38,575
There she is.

206
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,645
All right. Come on, Morty.
Let's go.

207
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,100
Oh, geez. Okay.

208
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,975
Oh, man, Rick.

209
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,444
What is this place?

210
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:48,306
It's dimension 35c,

211
00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:50,211
and it's got the perfect
climate conditions

212
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:53,446
for a special type
of tree, Morty, called a mega tree,

213
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:56,480
and there's fruit in those trees,
and there's seeds in those fruits.

214
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,845
I'm talking about mega seeds.

215
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,576
They're they're
incredibly powerful,

216
00:07:59,602 --> 00:08:02,100
and I need them to help me
with my research, Morty.

217
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,100
Oh, man, Rick.
I'm looking around this place,

218
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,450
and I'm starting to work up some
anxiety about this whole thing.

219
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,645
All right. All right.
Calm down. Listen to me, Morty.

220
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,845
I know that new situations can
be intimidating.

221
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,171
You're looking around,
and it's all scary and different,

222
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,315
but, you know,
m-meeting them head on,

223
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,374
charging right into them like a
bull that's how we grow as people.

224
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,244
I'm no stranger to
scary situations.

225
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:21,574
I deal with them all the time.

226
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:22,814
Now, if you just stick with me,

227
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:26,000
Morty, we're gonna be holy
crap, Morty, run!

228
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:28,475
I never seen that thing
before in my life.

229
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,215
I don't even know
what the hell it is!

230
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,670
We got to get out of here,
Morty!

231
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,500
It's gonna kill us!

232
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:33,444
We're gonna die!

233
00:08:33,569 --> 00:08:35,000
We're gonna die, Morty!

234
00:08:36,765 --> 00:08:38,214
Oh, Morty, take a deep breath.

235
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:40,140
Breathe that breathe that
fresh air in, Morty.

236
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,314
Y-you smell that?

237
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:43,175
That's the smell of
adventure, Morty.

238
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,675
That's that's the smell of

239
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,974
of of of a whole different
evolutionary timeline.

240
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:50,175
All right, Rick, look how
much longer is this gonna be?

241
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,775
Shouldn't I be back
at school by now?

242
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,944
Are you joking me?

243
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:55,029
I mean, look at all the crazy
crap surrounding us.

244
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,344
Look at that thing right there.
What the hell is that thing?

245
00:08:57,469 --> 00:08:59,730
You think you're gonna see that
kind of thing at school?

246
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,015
Look at it just
lumbering around.

247
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,675
It defies all logic that thing.

248
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,875
Yeah, Rick, I get it.

249
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,745
We're surrounded by monsters.

250
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,130
That's kind of the reason
why I want to leave.

251
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,960
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

252
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,145
Morty, you see this?

253
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,900
You see what we just
stumbled upon, Morty?

254
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Any idea what that
is down there?

255
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,000
The mega trees?

256
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,615
That's right, Morty the mega trees
with the mega fruit on them.

257
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,341
And that's what I'm talking
about, Morty.

258
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,410
That's where my seeds are.

259
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:23,564
If we would have done
what you wanted,

260
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,603
I would have never
have found them,

261
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:26,724
because you're
so in love with school.

262
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,115
All right, all right.

263
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,245
So, what's so special about
these seeds, anyways?

264
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,250
You ask a lot of
questions, Morty.

265
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,314
Not very charismatic.

266
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,944
It makes you kind of an
Under underfoot figure.

267
00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:37,074
Just take these shoes, Morty.

268
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:39,175
They're special grappling shoes.

269
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,775
When you're wearing these
things, these babies,

270
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,344
you can basically just walk on
any surface you want, Morty

271
00:09:44,469 --> 00:09:46,344
up, down, below, turn around to
the left.

272
00:09:46,469 --> 00:09:48,375
These things really bring it all
together.

273
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,350
Aah!

274
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,600
You have to turn them on, Morty!

275
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,275
The shoes have to be turned on!

276
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,175
I am not putting my
father in a home!

277
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,545
He just came back into my life,

278
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,271
and you want to grab him
and stuff him

279
00:10:00,397 --> 00:10:02,550
under a mattress like last
month's Victoria's secret?

280
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,765
I told you I was ordering you
something for Valentine's day.

281
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,320
More importantly, your father is
a horrible influence on our son.

282
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,015
Everything cool in here, Beth?

283
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,145
- It's fine, Davin.
- Okay, cool.

284
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,074
You know, we did
something great today.

285
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:19,415
There's nothing more noble and
free than the heart of a horse.

286
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,849
Since we're fighting, if you ever
have an affair with that guy,

287
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:26,010
I will come to the hotel room and blow my
brains out all over your naked bodies.

288
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:28,274
Look, I appreciate the
stress you're under, but...

289
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:31,145
Morty was having trouble in school
way before my dad moved in,

290
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,615
and the only influence I
can see Rick having...

291
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:38,000
is that, for the first time in
his life, Morty has a friend.

292
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,645
Well, maybe you're right.

293
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,974
Uh, yeah, maybe I am.

294
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:45,245
I'm my father's daughter.
I'm smart.

295
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,875
Why do you think I'm
a heart surgeon?

296
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,801
Horse heart surgeon.

297
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,375
Hello?

298
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,145
Mrs. Smith?

299
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,775
This is principal Vagina,
no relation.

300
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,545
I wonder if you and Morty's
father might be able

301
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:54,215
to have a chat
with me this afternoon?

302
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,249
Morty, oh, you really d-did a
number on your legs right now.

303
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:02,165
You know, you got to turn the shoes
on, Morty, for them to work.

304
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,300
Yeah, look I turned mine on.
I had no problem getting down here.

305
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:06,675
It was a leisurely breeze.

306
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,314
I'm in a lot of pain, Rick.

307
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:09,844
Yeah, I can see that.

308
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:13,538
But do you think you'll still be able
to help me collect my seeds, Morty?

309
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,675
Are you kidding me?!

310
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,814
That's it, Rick!

311
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:16,944
That's the last straw!

312
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:17,975
I can't believe this!

313
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,760
I'm sitting here with
both of my legs broken,

314
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,509
and you're still asking me
about getting those seeds?!

315
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,015
Ooh! Ow! Oh!

316
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,775
Y-y-you're a monster.

317
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,944
Y-you're like Hitler, but

318
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:29,214
but even Hitler cared about
Germany or something.

319
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:32,500
Okay, hold on just a
second, Morty.

320
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,844
Ooh.

321
00:11:50,969 --> 00:11:51,844
Ohh.

322
00:11:51,969 --> 00:11:52,944
Ooh.

323
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:54,675
Wow, Rick.

324
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,344
That stuff just healed my broken
legs instantly.

325
00:11:57,469 --> 00:11:59,875
I mean, I've never felt
so good in my life.

326
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,814
Thank you.

327
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:02,175
Don't worry about it, Morty.

328
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:04,275
Just come help me get these
seeds, all right, buddy?

329
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,214
Sure thing, Rick.

330
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:06,275
Not that you asked,

331
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,745
Morty, but what just
happened there is...

332
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,970
I went into a future dimension with
such advanced medicine...

333
00:12:11,004 --> 00:12:13,245
that they had broken-leg serum at
every corner drugstore.

334
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,915
The stuff was all over the
place, Morty.

335
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,574
Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick.

336
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:19,350
There's just one problem,
Morty one little hang-up.

337
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,814
The dimension I visited was so

338
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:22,175
advanced, they had also halted

339
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,745
the aging process, and everyone

340
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,145
there was young, Morty, and they
had been forever.

341
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,814
I was the only old
person there, Morty.

342
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:30,900
It was like I was some sort of, you
know, celebrity, walking around.

343
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,645
I-I was fascinating to them.

344
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,515
There were a lot of attractive
women there, Morty,

345
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,914
and they they they they
all wanted time with me.

346
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:38,074
I had a lot of fun with
a lot of young ladies,

347
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:40,145
but I spent so much time there,

348
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,850
my interdimensional portal device
it's got no charge left, Morty.

349
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,261
It's got no charge left!

350
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:45,900
- What?!
- It's as good as garbage, Morty.

351
00:12:45,969 --> 00:12:47,175
It's not gonna work anymore, Morty.

352
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,714
Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good.

353
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:49,814
W-what are we gonna do?

354
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:51,645
I-I have to be back at school
right now.

355
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,900
How are we gonna get back home?

356
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:57,059
There's ways to get back home, Morty. It's just
it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle.

357
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,014
We're gonna have to go through
interdimensional customs,

358
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,200
so you're gonna have
to do me a real solid.

359
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,675
When we get to customs,

360
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,780
I'm gonna need you to take
these seeds into the bathroom,

361
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,840
and I'm gonna need you to put them
way up inside your butthole, Morty.

362
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,800
In my butt? - Put them way up
inside there, as far as they can fit.

363
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,275
Oh, geez, Rick. I really don't
want to have to do that.

364
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,015
Well, somebody's got to
do it, Morty.

365
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,145
Th-these seeds aren't gonna get

366
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,500
through customs unless they're
in someone's rectum, Morty.

367
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,245
And they'll fall right
out of mine.

368
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,839
I've done this too
many times, Morty.

369
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,175
I mean, you're young.

370
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,460
You've got your whole
life ahead of you,

371
00:13:27,485 --> 00:13:29,885
and your anal cavity is
still taut, yet malleable.

372
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,415
You got to do it for grandpa, Morty.

373
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,275
Y-you've got to put these seeds
inside your butt.

374
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,875
- In my butt?
- Come on, Morty.

375
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,915
Please, Morty.
You have to do it, Morty.

376
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,915
Oh, man.

377
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,745
The fact is, your son, Morty,

378
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,145
has attended this school for a

379
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,375
total of seven hours over the
last two months.

380
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,275
What?
Why didn't you notify us?

381
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,645
I done been notifying you.

382
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,930
Have you not been getting the

383
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,900
messages I've been leaving with
Morty's grandfather?

384
00:13:49,969 --> 00:13:50,775
Boom!

385
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,574
Told you! In your face!
He is ruining our child!

386
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:55,545
Wait, what am I celebrating?

387
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,275
Yeah, see, I thought
something was fishy there,

388
00:13:57,322 --> 00:13:58,722
because it's usually
Morty's grandpa

389
00:13:58,747 --> 00:13:59,925
that's taking him out of school.

390
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:01,015
Summer?

391
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,844
What kind
of God lets this happen?

392
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,214
We had a little incident.

393
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:07,314
A student was frozen to death.

394
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:10,245
And there's no evidence that a
Latino student did it!

395
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,444
Everyone wants to take this
to a racial place.

396
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:13,545
I won't let them.

397
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:18,015
<i>The glarp zone is for
flarping and unglarping only.</i>

398
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,400
So, I told him, "give me the
blimfarx," you know?

399
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,925
This this guy he doesn't
understand interstellar currency.

400
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,460
It's, like, I'm trying to eat

401
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,300
a flimflam like, that's what
we eat on girvonesk.

402
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:30,000
<i>The glarp zone is for
flarping and unglarping only.</i>

403
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,645
I don't like it here, Morty.
I can't abide bureaucracy.

404
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,574
I don't like being told where to
go and what to do.

405
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:36,775
I consider it a violation.

406
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,615
Did you get those seeds all the
way up your butt?

407
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,645
Yeah, Rick.

408
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,175
Let's just get this
over with, okay?

409
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,100
I mean, these things are pointy.
They hurt.

410
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,645
That means they're good ones.

411
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,645
You're a good kid, Morty.

412
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,200
Those mega seeds are super
valuable to my work.

413
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,470
You've been a huge help to me.

414
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,250
I'm gonna be able to do
all kind of things with them.

415
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,000
It's gonna be great, Morty.

416
00:14:54,099 --> 00:14:55,015
All kinds of science.

417
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,500
Okay, next through.

418
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,050
Except you. You go over there.

419
00:14:58,099 --> 00:14:59,200
Why does he have to go
over there?

420
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,100
Random check.

421
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,700
He's got to go through
the new machine.

422
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,981
What new machine?

423
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:03,979
It's a new machine.

424
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:05,500
It detects stuff all the way up
your butt.

425
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,000
Run, Morty! Run!

426
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,814
Aah!

427
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:09,200
Red alert!

428
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:23,469
Ohhhhh!

429
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:34,000
Hey! Ohhhhhh.

430
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,500
Aah!

431
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Don't think about it!

432
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:39,915
Ooh!

433
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:43,745
Oh, nice, Morty!

434
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,900
The student becomes the teacher.

435
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,750
Whoooooo!

436
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,700
Aah!

437
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,000
Aw, hell, no, dawg.

438
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,375
You know me I'm just trying to-

439
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,675
Aah!

440
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,300
I need to type in the coordinates
to our home world, Morty.

441
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,844
- Cover me.
- Oh, man.

442
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,150
I mean, you know, I-I don't want
to shoot nobody.

443
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,270
They're just robots, Morty!

444
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,500
It's okay to shoot them!
They're robots!

445
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,750
Aah!

446
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:17,814
My leg is shot off!

447
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:19,700
Glenn's bleeding to death!

448
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,745
Someone call his
wife and children!

449
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,175
They're not robots, Rick!

450
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,300
It's a figure of speech, Morty.

451
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,974
They're bureaucrats.
I don't respect them.

452
00:16:26,099 --> 00:16:27,175
Just keep shooting, Morty.

453
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:30,000
You have no idea what prison
is like here!

454
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:34,814
Holy crap!
This is insane!

455
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Come on, Morty!

456
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,739
We got to get the
hell out of here!

457
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:52,675
Wow.

458
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,200
Did you just come into the
cafeteria through a portal?

459
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,545
Uh, yeah.

460
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,680
Well, you know, my my
Ferrari's in the shop.

461
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:01,144
Just kidding.

462
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:03,444
- You're Morty, right?
- Yeah.

463
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:04,915
You can get his number later.
Come on, Morty.

464
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,080
We got to get out of here.

465
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,915
You got to get those seeds out
of your ass.

466
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,000
Oh, look, honey. It's our
son with Albert Ein-douche.

467
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:11,750
What?

468
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,714
I'm an angry father,
not an improvisor.

469
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,214
Oh, hi, Jerry.

470
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,175
Oh, my goodness, Morty!

471
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,244
What are you doing out of class?

472
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,274
We talked about this.

473
00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:23,444
Your your parents and I are very
disappointed in in this behavior.

474
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
No? No takers?

475
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,175
You guys should really not be
touching that stuff.

476
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,675
- It's beyond your reasoning.
- You're beyond our reasoning!

477
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,744
Takes one to know one.

478
00:17:31,869 --> 00:17:33,044
Dad, how could you make

479
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:36,345
my son miss an entire
semester of school?

480
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,115
I mean, it's not like he's a hot
girl.

481
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,800
He can't just bail on his life and
set up shop in someone else's.

482
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:42,274
What what are you
guys doing with my stuff?

483
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,845
We're moving you... to a
nursing home.

484
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,014
A nursing home?

485
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:46,944
What are what are you, nuts?

486
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm a genius.
I build robots for fun.

487
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,044
Well, now you can
build baskets and watch

488
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:52,944
Paul Newman movies on VHS...

489
00:17:53,069 --> 00:17:55,000
and mentally scar the boy scouts
every Christmas.

490
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,645
- What does that mean?
- It's personal.

491
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,974
Dad, mom, come on.

492
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:00,950
Rick just needed my help is all.

493
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,815
Morty, stay out of this.

494
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,014
You are obviously not capable of

495
00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:05,744
judging these
situations on your own.

496
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:06,645
What are you trying to
say about Morty?

497
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:07,845
That he's stupid or something?

498
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,615
Oh, don't high-road us, dad.

499
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,075
You know fully well that Morty

500
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,774
is the last child that needs to
be missing classes.

501
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:15,244
I-I-I don't know what
you mean by that.

502
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:17,369
Can can can you be a
little bit more specific?

503
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:20,024
Oh, for crying out he's got some
kind of disability or something.

504
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,744
Is that what you want us to say?

505
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:23,214
I do?

506
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:24,774
Well, duh doy, son.

507
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:27,244
Look, I love you, Morty, but...

508
00:18:27,369 --> 00:18:29,015
we both know you're not as
fast as the other kids,

509
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,675
and if you want
to compete in this world,

510
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,874
you got to work twice as hard.

511
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:34,415
Aw, geez, dad.

512
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,774
Y-you know, that's a lot to drop
on a kid all at once.

513
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:39,915
Morty, t-tell your
parents the square root of pi.

514
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,775
Oh, come on, Rick.
You know I can't.

515
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,080
The square root of pi, Morty.
Go!

516
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:46,375
1.77245385.

517
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,514
Whoa!

518
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:48,944
What the hell?

519
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:50,544
Holy crap. He's right.

520
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:53,000
Morty, tell your parents the
first law of Thermodynamics.

521
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,470
"The increment in the
internal energy of a system is...

522
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,944
equal to the increment of heat
supplied to the system."

523
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:01,174
Wow! I'm so smart!

524
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:03,815
But I told the both of
you school is stupid.

525
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,274
It's not how you learn things.

526
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:07,645
Morty's a gifted child.
He has a special mind.

527
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,444
That's why he's
my little helper.

528
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:10,544
He's like me.

529
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:13,675
He's gonna be doing great
science stuff later in his life.

530
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,974
He's too smart for school.

531
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:18,345
He needs to keep hanging out
and helping me.

532
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,065
Jerry, I don't want whatever's
happening here to stop.

533
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,675
No, I-I understand.

534
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,274
Uh, maybe we overreacted.

535
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:27,675
But he has to keep
going to school.

536
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,875
Okay, Jerry.

537
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,899
You drive a hard bargain, but
what am I supposed to do?

538
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,115
Say no?

539
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,115
You you really wear the pants
around here.

540
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,315
I just want you to know,

541
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,744
between us, from now on,
it's gonna be

542
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:40,774
100% honesty and open,
clear communication.

543
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:43,214
Frank Palicky was
frozen to death today!

544
00:19:43,339 --> 00:19:44,675
No idea what you're
talking about.

545
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,044
Okay.

546
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:49,315
Well, uh, Morty, it's your
bedtime in an hour.

547
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,845
Don't stay up all night again.

548
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,274
This is good, though.
This can work.

549
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,044
I think we can be a family.

550
00:19:55,169 --> 00:20:00,115
And now, Beth, if you'll have me,
I would love to have you.

551
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,915
You know what?
Okay.

552
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,115
Holy cow, Rick.

553
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,575
I didn't know hanging out with
you was making me smarter.

554
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,214
Full disclosure, Morty it's not.

555
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:12,115
Temporary superintelligence is
just a side effect of the mega

556
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,899
seeds dissolving in
your rectal cavity.

557
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:14,974
Aw, man.

558
00:20:15,099 --> 00:20:17,714
Yeah, and once those
seeds wear off,

559
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:19,615
you're gonna lose most
of your motor skills,

560
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,675
and you're also gonna lose
a significant amount of

561
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,915
brain functionality for 72
hours, Morty.

562
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,000
Starting right about now.

563
00:20:26,069 --> 00:20:29,075
Ohh, man.
Oh, geez! Ohh.

564
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,075
I'm sorry, Morty.
It's a bummer.

565
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,944
In reality, you're as
dumb as they come.

566
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:35,888
And I needed those seeds real bad,
and I had to give them up

567
00:20:35,914 --> 00:20:37,773
just to get your
parents off my back,

568
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:39,268
so now we're gonna
have to go get more.

569
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:41,915
And then we're gonna go on even
more adventures after that, Morty.

570
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,544
And you're gonna keep your mouth
shut about it, Morty,

571
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:46,820
because the world is full of idiots that
don't understand

572
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,974
what's important, and they'll
tear us apart, Morty.

573
00:20:49,074 --> 00:20:51,715
But if you stick with me, I'm gonna
accomplish great things, Morty,

574
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,999
and you're gonna
be part of them,

575
00:20:54,024 --> 00:20:55,699
and together, we're gonna
run around, Morty.

576
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,135
We're gonna do all kinds of
wonderful things, Morty.

577
00:20:57,161 --> 00:20:58,100
Just you and me, Morty.

578
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,375
The outside world is
our enemy, Morty.

579
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,575
We're the only friends
we've got, Morty.

580
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,879
It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and
Morty and their adventures, Morty.

581
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:07,714
Rick and Morty
forever and forever.

582
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,774
100 years, Rick and
Morty's things.

583
00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:13,774
Me and Rick and Morty running
around, and Rick and Morty time.

584
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:15,474
All day long, forever.

585
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:17,044
All a hundred days.

586
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:18,714
Rick and Morty
forever 100 times.
