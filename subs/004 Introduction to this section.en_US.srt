Hi guys, and welcome to this Python refresher.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,766
In this section we're going to learn about all of the main features of Python

3
00:00:05,766 --> 00:00:08,799
features of Python, that you might need for this course.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,266
As such, it's a bit of a long section.

5
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:14,499
So, there's a couple of things you can do in order to speed through it faster.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,266
This is what you'll see when you are in the course

7
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:21,532
and you can see on the right you've got all of your lectures.

8
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:23,466
If you know the contents of any one lecture,

9
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:26,332
for example, you already know about string formatting in Python,

10
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,033
then you can skip that video entirely.

11
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:32,833
And, if you want to mark it as complete, you can do so by just clicking on this little box there.

12
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:36,833
I do recommend that if you speed through the videos, you have a look at a couple of points

13
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:39,733
throughout the video to make sure that you do know everything that's covered.

14
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:43,333
In addition, something else you can use to go through these videos faster,

15
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:46,899
is the "Speed Playback Rate" in the Udemy Player.

16
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,100
If you think I'm speaking too slowly, or you just want to go quickly through the videos, you can always click on it

17
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,166
and change the speed setting.

18
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,832
As long as you can understand me, you'll be okay.

19
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,966
Thank you for joining me again in this course. I hope you'll enjoy it.

20
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:01,232
I'll see you in the next video!
